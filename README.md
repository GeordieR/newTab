# Quick Earth

Quick Earth is a personalised new tab page that shows a series of quick links on top of [Google Earth View](https://earthview.withgoogle.com/) images.

This project was a way for me to learn more about HTML/CSS/JavaScript. I adapted a [python script](https://github.com/GeordieR/earthview) to download the metadata for each photo. I then saved this to a JSON to be used by the quickEarth JavaScript to display the photo and metadata.
